Installing MySQL:
	- download and install MySQL (ensure Connector/J is installed too)
	- set the username to 'eclipse' and password to 'Excellence'
	if you've already installed MySQL with different credentials, need to set these in db project

Setting up our database:
	- open the MySQL workbench (at least, if you're like me and like easy-to-use GUIs!)
	- create schema 'eclipse' with default collation
	- set newly created schema as the default schema
	- execute 'create_tables_mysql.sql' script (found in the same folder as this document)
	
Getting it working with our project:
	- add the J Connector jar file to your system's classpath
	- J Connector should have been installed with MySQL; if not, download and extract locally
	- instead of adding to classpath, can copy and past jar file to your JRE lib\ext folder (ex. C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\lib\ext)
