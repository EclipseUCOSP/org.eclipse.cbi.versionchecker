TODO: need to remove the VersionChecker.jar and my.db from the repo once the version checker is hosted on nexus.

To call the plugin with user inputed query either:
- mvn mvn-p2-vt:callVC -DcallVC.query="your query"
- mvn mvn-p2-vt:callVC (will prompt for query)

Adding <pluginGroup>mvn.p2.vt</pluginGroup> under <pluginGroups> in your Maven settings.xml will allow you to call the plugin like this: mvn mvn.p2.vt:goal

If you get the error:
Unbound classpath variable: 'M2_REPO/...' in project '...' it means you have not setup your M2_REPO variable as a classpath variable in Eclipse. To fix this:

- Open Eclipse Preferences
- Go to Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables
- Add a variable named M2_REPO
- Click Folder... and select your repository folder. This will be in user home directory under .m2, ie /Users/AUser/.m2/repository

You can also do this by running the following maven command:
mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo
