TODO:
	- need to remove the my.db from the repo and use one hosted on nexus
	- may want to save this until after most db functionality and testing complete, however

Perform the following steps to run the plugin:
	- mvn clean install
	- mvn org.ucosp.eclipse:mvn-p2-vt-plugin:callVC
	- an add entry for this project is sent to MVNP2Util

If you get the error:
Unbound classpath variable: 'M2_REPO/...' in project '...' it means you have not setup your M2_REPO variable as a classpath variable in Eclipse. To fix this:

- Open Eclipse Preferences
- Go to Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables
- Add a variable named M2_REPO
- Click Folder... and select your repository folder. This will be in user home directory under .m2, ie /Users/AUser/.m2/repository

You can also do this by running the following maven command:
mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo
