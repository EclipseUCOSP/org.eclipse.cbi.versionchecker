Installing MySQL:
	- download and install MySQL (ensure Connector/J is installed too)
		- set the username to 'root' and password to 'Excellence'
		 if you've already installed MySQL with different credentials, need to set these in db project

Setting up our database:
	- open the MySQL workbench (at least, if you're like me and like easy-to-use GUIs!)
	- create schema 'eclipse' with default collation
		- set newly created schema as the default schema
	- execute 'create_tables_mysql.sql' script (found in the same folder as this document)
